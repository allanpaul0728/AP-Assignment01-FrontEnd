Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","owners":[{"id":16,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/16/?format=json","name":"Canadian Space Agency","abbrev":"CSA"},{"id":27,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/27/?format=json","name":"European Space Agency","abbrev":"ESA"},{"id":37,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/37/?format=json","name":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","abbrev":"JAXA"},{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","abbrev":"NASA"},{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","abbrev":"RFSA"}],"image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"},{"id":5,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/spacestation/5/?format=json","name":"Mir","status":{"id":2,"name":"De-Orbited"},"type":{"id":2,"name":"Government"},"founded":"1986-02-20","deorbited":"2001-03-23","description":"Mir was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia.

In 1979 it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of 170,000 pounds (77,000 kg). Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Three missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo command and service module (Apollo CSM), launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket. For the final two manned missions to Skylab, a backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed, but this backup vehicle was never flown.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","owners":[{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","abbrev":"NASA"}],"image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/skylab_image_20190215230143.jpeg"},{"id":7,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/spacestation/7/?format=json","name":"Tiangong 1","status":{"id":2,"name":"De-Orbited"},"type":{"id":2,"name":"Government"},"founded":"2011-09-29","deorbited":"2018-04-02","description":"Tiangong-1 (Chinese: 天宫一号; pinyin: Tiāngōng yīhào; literally: \"Heavenly Palace 1\" or \"Celestial Palace 1\") was China's first prototype space station.

The first of these, the unmanned Shenzhou 8, successfully docked with the module in November 2011, while the manned Shenzhou 9 mission docked in June 2012. A third and final mission to Tiangong-1, the manned Shenzhou 10, docked in June 2013.

They went on to state that the telemetry link with Tiangong-1 had been lost. A couple of months later, amateur satellite trackers watching Tiangong-1 found that China's space agency had lost control of the station. In September, after conceding they had lost control over the station, officials speculated that the station would re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere late in 2017. According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, Tiangong-1 started reentry over the southern Pacific Ocean, northwest of Tahiti, on 2 April 2018 at 00:15 UTC.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","owners":[{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/17/?format=json","name":"China National Space Administration","abbrev":"CNSA"}],"image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/tiangong25201_image_20190215013038.jpeg"},{"id":8,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/spacestation/8/?format=json","name":"Tiangong 2","status":{"id":2,"name":"De-Orbited"},"type":{"id":2,"name":"Government"},"founded":"2016-09-15","deorbited":"2019-07-19","description":"Tiangong-2 (Chinese: 天宫二号; pinyin: Tiāngōng èrhào; literally: \"Celestial Palace 2\") is a Chinese space laboratory and part of the Project 921-2 space station program.

Due to the military nature of the station, the Soviet Union was reluctant to release information about its design, and about the missions relating to the station.\r\n\r\nIt attained an altitude of 219 to 270 km on launch and NASA reported its final orbital altitude was 268 to 272 km.
